  Where to go from here
Now that you have completed the prework, what are the next steps?

Read "What is a program" on https://java.codeup.com/prework/prework/fundamentals/
Review fundamental vocabulary and concepts. https://java.codeup.com/prework/prework/vocab/decimal-number-system/
Familiarize yourself with "How the Web Works". https://java.codeup.com/prework/prework/vocab/how-the-web-works/
Learn about version control with Git. https://java.codeup.com/prework/prework/versioning/. We'll be using git heavily in the course, so your time would be well spent getting familiar with it. You can even sign up for a GitHub account and put the work you've done on the prework on your profile! Go through this Interactive Git Tutorial https://learngitbranching.js.org/ and "Learn Git" on Codeacademy. https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git
Get as comfortable as you can with the command line. We'll be using the command line during class, so it's good to come prepared. Go through the "Intro to Command Line" at https://java.codeup.com/prework/prework/cli/ do CodeAcademy's Command Line intro at https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line.
Keep Practicing! Keep playing with your existing JavaScript exercises and trying new things!
Keep on practicing and ask questions! We look forward to seeing you in class!
